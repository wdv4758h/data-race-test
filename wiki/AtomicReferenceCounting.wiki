#summary Description of atomic reference counting and challenges for race detectors.

= Introduction =

Various detectors of data races (such as  [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html Helgrind], [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/drd-manual.html DRD], [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-parallel-inspector/ Intel Parallel Inspector] or ThreadSanitizer) rely on their ability to intercept and interpret synchronization events of the analyzed program. For example, all these race detectors know the semantics of `pthread_mutex_lock` and similar functions. However, it is hard or impossible to interpret raw atomic instructions as synchronization (e.g. treating every compare-and-exchange instruction or every instruction with lock prefix as a synchronization event will make the analysis very slow and conservative). 

One of the most frequent patterns of lock-free synchronization is *atomic reference counting*.
{{{
class RefCounted {
 public:
  Ref() {
    AtomicIncrement(&ref);
  }
  Unref() {
    if (AtomicDecrement(&ref_) == 0) {
      delete this;
    }
  }
 private:
  AtomicInt ref_;
}
}}}

In order to avoid false warnings, race detectors need to understand that the reference counting implements correct synchronization. 
Namely, the tools need to understand that every event occurred before the decrement *happens-before* the events that occur after the reference counter became zero. 

With the DynamicAnnotations the most straightforward way to explain this to the tool 
is to annotated the code of `Unref()`:
{{{
  Unref() {
    ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_BEFORE(&ref_);
    if (AtomicDecrement(&ref_) == 0) {
      ANNOTATE_HAPPENS_AFTER(&ref_);
      delete this;
    }
  }
}}}
