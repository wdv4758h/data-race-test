#summary ThreadSanitizer for Microsoft Windows

We have a *work-in-progress* version of ThreadSanitizer for Windows. 
This version is based on [http://www.pintool.org PIN].

= Installation =
The installation is a bit tricky since the Windows variant of ThreadSanitizer depends on 
third party software which can not be distributed here (but which you can download for free). 

  * Download [http://www.pintool.org PIN] revision 31933 for Windows msvc8 from http://www.pintool.org/downloads.html
    * Extract the file somewhere on your disk (e.g. to *c:/pin*)
    * Make sure to install fresh *dbghelp.dll* as described there. 
  * Download:
    * tsan-rxxxx-x86-windows-ts_pin.dll or tsan-rxxx-x86-windows-debug-ts_pin.dll from ThreadSanitizerBuildBot 
      * remane it to x86-windows-ts_pin.dll
    * http://code.google.com/p/data-race-test/source/browse/trunk/tsan/tsan.bat
  * Put both files into the PIN installation directory (e.g. *c:/pin*)
  * Run ThreadSanitizer as `c:\pin\tsan.bat [tsan parameters] -- program [program parameters]`
