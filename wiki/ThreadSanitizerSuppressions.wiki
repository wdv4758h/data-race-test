#summary ThreadSanitizer Suppressions

ThreadSanitizer supports suppression mechanism, which extends [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/manual-core.html#manual-core.suppress regular valgrind suppressions]

Our extensions:
 * Multiple stack traces for one suppression rule are supported. Each stack trace must be enclosed by curly braces. As always, { and } should be on lines of their own.
 * Demangled C++ function names are supported. They must be prefixed with "cxx:".

Example of new syntax:
{{{
{
  suppression_name
  tool_name:warning_name
  {
    fun:mangled_function_name_wildcard
    obj:object_name_wildcard
    ...
    cxx:demangled_function_name_wildcard
  }
  {
    ...
    fun:another_mangled_function_name_wildcard
  }
}
}}}
