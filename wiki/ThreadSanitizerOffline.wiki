#summary Experimental offline race detector

=ThreadSanitizer offline=
We have an experimental offline race detector. 
It does not depend on any binary instrumentation framework. 
Instead, it simply reads events from a text file. 
Currently, the only supported event syntax mimics 
the events generated by Valgrind-based ThreadSanitizer, but we can 
support any syntax we need. 

This is all experimental, don't expect anything here to be really usable (yet).

== How to try == 
Get, build and run ThreadSanitizerOffline:
{{{
svn co   http://data-race-test.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/tsan
cd tsan 
make -j  -f ts_makefile 
./ts_offline  --fast-mode=no --show_pc    < offline_tests/simple_race_1.tst
}}}

If you are lucky, you may get the following output: 
{{{
