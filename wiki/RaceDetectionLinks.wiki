#summary Links related to race detection

= Please HELP!!! =

Reader, we need your help!
We want to collect an exhaustive and well annotated list of links to all materials related to race detection. 

== Race detectors == 

  * Intel Thread Checker

== General bug-finding links == 

  * http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext/ -- extremely entertaining reading about the "Coverity" static analysis tool. 
  
== TODO ==
*TODO* add all links we already have somewhere. 

*TODO* find new interesting links.
