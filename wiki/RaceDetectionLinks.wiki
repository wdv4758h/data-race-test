#summary Links related to race detection

= Please HELP!!! =

Reader, we need your help!
We want to collect an exhaustive and well annotated list of links to all materials related to race detection. 


  * Intel Thread Checker
    * Pure happens-before race detector, available on both Windows and Linux
    * Supports annotations (*TODO*: find a link to help/manual!)
    * Supports both compile-time and run-time instrumentation
    * A couple of papers are available:
      # [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1147416 U. Banerjee, B. Bliss, Z. Ma, and P. Petersen. A theory of data race detection]
      # [http://software.intel.com/file/6311 U. Banerjee, B. Bliss, Z. Ma, and P. Petersen. Unraveling Data Race Detection in the IntelÂ® Thread Checker]
    * [http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-thread-checker/ Product homepage]
    * Available for download the Linux version for noncommercial use
  * Sun Thread Analyzer
    * Hyrbid race detector, available on Solaris, SuSE Linux Enterprise Server 9 and the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4
    * Supports annotations ([http://developers.sun.com/sunstudio/downloads/tha/tha_using.html#User%20APIs documentation])
    * Requires compile-time instrumentation
    * TODO: download site, link to paper (any available?), comments
  * Helgrind
    * Pure happens-before race detector (since 3.4), available on Linux and Mac
    * Doesn't support annotations (as of August 14, work in progress)
    * Based on Valgrind run-time instrumentation framework
    * Open sourced as a part of Valgrind ([http://valgrind.org/downloads/ download], [http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/hg-manual.html manual])
    * TODO: paper (any available?), comments
  * DRD
    * Pure happens-before race detector, available on Linux and Mac
    * Annotations are (partly?) supported (as of August 14, work in progress)

*TODO* add all links we already have somewhere. 

*TODO* find new interesting links.
