#summary ThreadSanitizer build bot

We have a continuous build of ThreadSanitizer at http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/waterfall

You may download the latest ThreadSanitizer binaries (Linux x86/X86_64, Mac and Windows) at
http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries.<BR>
For example, for x86_64 Linux you will need the binary [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/tsan-r1908-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh].

To get it do:
{{{
wget http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/tsan-r1908-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh
chmod +x tsan-r1908-amd64-linux-self-contained.sh
}}}

For Windows, you need the self-extracting archive called *tsan-rxxx-x86-windows-sfx.exe*. <BR>
For example, [http://build.chromium.org/buildbot/tsan/binaries/tsan-r1938-x86-windows-sfx.exe].

When downloading a fresh binary make sure that the build bot is green.
